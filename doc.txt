activation formula
calcualte weights from the inputs, add them up and add bias. then decide if its activated or not
using threshold.


final step evaluate predicted output vs expected output through cost function
MSE, cross entropy
based on this value model know how much to adjust its parametrs

backpropagation algo
which is repeadetly adjusting weaights and biases to minimaze this cost
level of adjustment is determined by the gradient of cost function with respect to parameters

gradient descent - minimize cost
inputs mulyiplied by weights
